[Mictronics' `readsb-protobuf`](https://github.com/Mictronics/readsb-protobuf) Mode-S/ADSB/TIS decoder for RTLSDR, BladeRF, Modes-Beast and GNS5894 devices, running in a docker container.

This version uses Google's protocol buffer for data storage and exchange with web application. Saves on storage space and bandwidth.

This container also contains InfluxData's [Telegraf](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/), and can send flight data and `readsb` metrics to InfluxDB (if wanted - not started by default).

Support for all supported SDRs is compiled in. Builds and runs on x86_64, arm32v7 and arm64v8 (see below).

This image will configure a software-defined radio (SDR) to receive and decode Mode-S/ADSB/TIS data from aircraft within range, for use with other services such as:

* [`sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsbexchange`](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsbexchange) to feed ADSB data to [adsbexchange.com](https://adsbexchange.com)
* [`sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsbhub`](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsbhub) to feed ADSB data into [adsbhub.org](https://adsbhub.org/)
* [`sdr-enthusiasts/docker-piaware`](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-piaware) to feed ADSB data into [flightaware.com](https://flightaware.com)
* [`sdr-enthusiasts/docker-flightradar24`](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-flightradar24) to feed ADSB data into [flightradar24.com](https://www.flightradar24.com)
* [`sdr-enthusiasts/docker-radarbox`](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-radarbox) to feed ADSB data into [radarbox.com](https://www.radarbox.com)
* [`sdr-enthusiasts/docker-opensky-network`](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-opensky-network) to feed ADSB data into [opensky-network.org](https://opensky-network.org/)
* [`sdr-enthusiasts/docker-planefinder`](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-planefinder) to feed ADSB data into [planefinder.net](https://planefinder.net/)
* `mikenye/adsb-to-influxdb` to feed data into your own instance of [InfluxDB](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/), for visualisation with [Grafana](https://grafana.com) and/or other tools
* Any other tools that can receive Beast, BeastReduce, Basestation or the raw data feed from `readsb` or `dump1090` and their variants

bladeRF & plutoSDR are untested - I don't own bladeRF or plutoSDR hardware (only RTL2832U as outlined above), but support for the devices is compiled in. If you have the hardware and would be willing to test, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf/issues).

## Supported tags and respective Dockerfiles

* `latest` should always contain the latest released versions of `rtl-sdr`, `bladeRF`, `libiio`, `libad9361-iio` and `readsb`. This image is built nightly from the [`main` branch](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf) [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf/blob/main/Dockerfile) for all supported architectures.
* `latest_nohealthcheck` is the same as the `latest` version above. However, this version has the docker healthcheck removed. This is done for people running platforms (such as [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io)) that don't support manually disabling healthchecks, where healthchecks are not wanted.
* Specific version and architecture tags are available if required, however these are not regularly updated. It is generally recommended to run `latest`.

## Multi Architecture Support

Currently, this image should pull and run on the following architectures:

* ```amd64```: Linux x86-64
* ```arm32v7```, ```armv7l```: ARMv7 32-bit (Odroid HC1/HC2/XU4, RPi 2/3)
* ```arm64v8```, ```aarch64```: ARMv8 64-bit (RPi 3B+/4)

## Prerequisites

Before this container will work properly, you must blacklist the kernel modules for the RTL-SDR USB device from the host's kernel.

To do this, create a file `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-rtl2832.conf` containing the following:

```shell
# Blacklist RTL2832 so docker container readsb can use the device

blacklist rtl2832
blacklist dvb_usb_rtl28xxu
blacklist rtl2832_sdr
```

Once this is done, you can plug in your RTL-SDR USB device and start the container.

Failure to do this will result in the error below being spammed to the container log.

```
usb_claim_interface error -6
rtlsdr: error opening the RTLSDR device: Device or resource busy
```

If you get the error above even after blacklisting the kernel modules as outlined above, the modules may still be loaded. You can unload them by running the following commands:

```shell
sudo rmmod rtl2832_sdr
sudo rmmod dvb_usb_rtl28xxu
sudo rmmod rtl2832
```

## Identifying your SDR's device path

Plug in your USB radio, and run the command `lsusb`. Find your radio. It'll look something like this:

```
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 0bda:2832 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL2832U DVB-T
```

Take note of the **USB bus number**, and **USB device number**. In the output above, its **001** and **004** respectively. While the individual device can be passed through (`/dev/bus/usb/001/004` in this case), it's more reliable to pass the entire USB bus through, as seen in the examples below.

## Up-and-Running with `docker run`

Start the docker container, passing through the USB device:

```shell
docker volume create readsbpb_rrd
docker volume create readsbpb_autogain
docker run \
 -d \
 -it \
 --restart=always \
 --name readsb \
 --hostname readsb \
 --device /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
 -p 8080:8080 \
 -p 30005:30005 \
 -e TZ=<YOUR_TIMEZONE> \
 -e READSB_DCFILTER=true \
 -e READSB_DEVICE_TYPE=rtlsdr \
 -e READSB_FIX=true \
 -e READSB_GAIN=autogain \
 -e READSB_LAT=<YOUR_LATITUDE> \
 -e READSB_LON=<YOUR_LONGITUDE> \
 -e READSB_MODEAC=true \
 -e READSB_RX_LOCATION_ACCURACY=2 \
 -e READSB_STATS_RANGE=true \
 -e READSB_NET_ENABLE=true \
 -v readsbpb_autogain:/run/autogain \
 -v readsbpb_rrd:/run/collectd \
 --tmpfs=/run:exec,size=64M \
 --tmpfs=/var/log:size=32M \
 ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf:latest
```

For example:

```shell
docker volume create readsbpb_rrd
docker volume create readsbpb_autogain
docker run \
 -d \
 -it \
 --restart=always \
 --name readsb \
 --hostname readsb \
 --device /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
 -p 8080:8080 \
 -p 30005:30005 \
 -e TZ=Australia/Perth \
 -e READSB_DCFILTER=true \
 -e READSB_DEVICE_TYPE=rtlsdr \
 -e READSB_FIX=true \
 -e READSB_GAIN=autogain \
 -e READSB_LAT=33.33333 \
 -e READSB_LON=-111.11111 \
 -e READSB_MODEAC=true \
 -e READSB_RX_LOCATION_ACCURACY=2 \
 -e READSB_STATS_RANGE=true \
 -e READSB_NET_ENABLE=true \
 -v readsbpb_autogain:/run/autogain \
 -v readsbpb_rrd:/run/collectd \
 --tmpfs=/run:exec,size=64M \
 --tmpfs=/var/log:size=32M \
 ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf:latest
```

Alternatively, you could pass through the entire USB bus with `--device /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb`, but please understand the security implications of doing so.

## Up-and-Running with Docker Compose

An example `docker-compose.yml` file is below:

```yaml
version: '2.0'

networks:
  adsbnet:

volumes:
  readsbpb_rrd:
  readsbpb_autogain:

services:

  readsb:
    image: ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf:latest
    tty: true
    container_name: readsb
    hostname: readsb
    restart: always
    devices:
      - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
      - 30005:30005
    networks:
      - adsbnet
    environment:
      - TZ=Australia/Perth
      - READSB_DCFILTER=true
      - READSB_DEVICE_TYPE=rtlsdr
      - READSB_FIX=true
      - READSB_GAIN=autogain
      - READSB_LAT=-33.33333
      - READSB_LON=111.11111
      - READSB_MODEAC=true
      - READSB_RX_LOCATION_ACCURACY=2
      - READSB_STATS_RANGE=true
      - READSB_NET_ENABLE=true
    volumes:
      - readsbpb_rrd:/run/collectd
      - readsbpb_autogain:/run/autogain
    tmpfs:
      - /run/readsb:size=64M
      - /var/log:size=32M

```

## Testing the container

Once running, you can test the container to ensure it is correctly receiving & decoding ADSB traffic by issuing the command:

```shell
docker exec -it readsb viewadsb
```

Which should display a departure-lounge-style screen showing all the aircraft being tracked, for example:

#### `READSB_NET_CONNECTOR` syntax

This variable allows you to configure outgoing connections. The variable takes a semicolon (`;`) separated list of `ip,port,protocol`, where:

* `ip` is an IP address. Specify an IP/hostname/containername for outgoing connections.
* `port` is a TCP port number
* `protocol` can be one of the following:
  * `beast_out`: Beast-format output
  * `beast_in`: Beast-format input
  * `raw_out`: Raw output
  * `raw_in`: Raw input
  * `sbs_out`: SBS-format output
  * `vrs_out`: SBS-format output

For example, to pull in MLAT results (so the performance graphs in the web interface show MLAT numbers), you could do the following:

```yaml
    environment:
    ...
      - READSB_NET_CONNECTOR=piaware,30105,beast_in;adsbx,30105,beast_in;rbfeeder,30105,beast_in
    ...
```

| `8080/tcp` | `readsb` web interface |

In addition to the ports listed above, depending on your `readsb` configuration the container may also be listening on other ports that you'll need to map through (if external connectivity is required).

Some common ports are as follows (which may or may not be in use depending on your configuration):

| Port | Details |
|------|---------|
| `30001/tcp` | Raw protocol input |
| `30002/tcp` | Raw protocol output |
| `30003/tcp` | SBS/Basestation protocol output |
| `30004/tcp` | Beast protocol input |
| `30005/tcp` | Beast protocol output |
| `30104/tcp` | Beast protocol input |

## Paths & Volumes

| Path (inside container) | Details |
|-------------------------|---------|
| `/run/readsb` | `readsb` protobuf file storage. Not necessarily required to be mapped to persistant storage. |
| `/run/collectd` | `collectd` RRD file storage used by `readsb`'s "performance graphs" in the web interface. Map to persistant storage if you use this feature. |
| `/run/autogain` | Map this to persistant storage if you set `READSB_GAIN=autogain` |

## Auto-Gain system

An automatic gain adjustment system is included in this container, and can be activated by setting the environment variable `READSB_GAIN` to `autogain`. You should also map `/run/autogain` to persistant storage, otherwise the auto-gain system will start over each time the container is restarted.

*Why is this written in bash?* Because I wanted to keep the container size down and not have to install an interpreter like python. I don't know C/Go/Perl or any other languages.

Auto-gain will take several weeks to initially (over the period of a week or so) work out feasible maximum and minimum gain levels for your environment. It will then perform a fine-tune process to find the optimal gain level.

During each process, gain levels are ranked as follows:

* The range achievable by each gain level
* The signal-to-noise ratio of the receiver

The ranking process is done by sorting the gain levels for each statistic from worst to best, then awarding points. 0 points are awarded for the worst gain level, 1 point for the next gain level all the way up to several points for the best gain level (total number of points is the number of gain levels tested). The number of points for each gain level is totalled, and the optimal gain level is the level with the largest number of points. Any gain level with a percentage of "strong signals" outside of `AUTOGAIN_PERCENT_STRONG_MESSAGES_MAX` and `AUTOGAIN_PERCENT_STRONG_MESSAGES_MIN` is discarded.

Using this method, auto-gain tried to achieve the best balance of range, tracks and signal-to-noise ratio, whilst ensuring an appropriate number of "strong signals".

The auto-gain system will work as follows:

### Initialisation Stage

In the initialisation process:

1. `readsb` is set to maximum gain (`AUTOGAIN_MAX_GAIN_VALUE`).
1. Results are collected up to `AUTOGAIN_INITIAL_PERIOD` (up to 2 hours by default).
1. Check to ensure at least `AUTOGAIN_INITIAL_MSGS_ACCEPTED` messages have been locally accepted (1,000,000 by default). If not, continue collecting data for up to 24 hours. This combination of time and number of messages ensures we have enough data to make a valid initial assessment of each gain level.
1. Gain level is lowered by one level.
1. Gain levels are reviewed from lowest to highest gain level. If there have been gain levels resulting in a percentage of strong messages between `AUTOGAIN_PERCENT_STRONG_MESSAGES_MAX` and `AUTOGAIN_PERCENT_STRONG_MESSAGES_MIN`, and there have been three consecutive gain levels above `AUTOGAIN_PERCENT_STRONG_MESSAGES_MAX`, auto-gain lowers the maximum gain level.
1. Gain levels are reviewed from highest to lowest gain level. If there have been gain levels resulting in a percentage of strong messages between `AUTOGAIN_PERCENT_STRONG_MESSAGES_MAX` and `AUTOGAIN_PERCENT_STRONG_MESSAGES_MIN`, and there have been three consecutive gain levels below `AUTOGAIN_PERCENT_STRONG_MESSAGES_MIN`, auto-gain discontinues testing gain levels.

Auto-gain then moves onto the fine-tuning stage.

### Fine-Tuning Stage

In the fine-tuning process:

1. `readsb` is set to maximum gain level chosen at the end of the initialisation process.
1. Results are collected up to `AUTOGAIN_FINETUNE_PERIOD` (7 days by default).
1. Check to ensure at least `AUTOGAIN_FINETUNE_MSGS_ACCEPTED` messages have been locally accepted (7,000,000 by default). If not, continue collecting data for up to 48 hours. This combination of time and number of messages ensures we have enough data to make an accurate assessment of each gain level, and by using 7 days this ensures any peaks/troughs in data due to quiet/busy days of the week do not skew results.
1. Gain level is lowered by one level until the minimum gain level chosen at the end of the initialisation process is reached.

At this point, all of the tested gain levels are ranked based on the criterea discussed above.

The gain level with the most points is chosen, and `readsb` is set to this gain level.

Auto-gain then moves onto the finished stage.

### Finished Stage

In the finished stage, auto-gain does nothing (as `readsb` is operating at optimal gain) for `AUTOGAIN_FINISHED_PERIOD` (1 year by default). After this time, auto-gain reverts to the initialisation stage and the entire process is completed again. This makes sure your configuration is always running at the optimal gain level as your RTLSDR ages.

### State/Log/Stats Files

All files for auto-gain are located at `/run/autogain` within the container. They should not be modified by hand.

### Forcing auto-gain to re-run from scratch

Run `docker exec <container_name> rm /run/autogain/*` to remove all existing auto-gain state data. Restart the container and auto-gain will detect this and re-start at initialisation stage.

## Advanced Usage: Creating an MLAT Hub

There may be reasons you wish to use `readsb` to combine MLAT feeds from different collectors, to feed into visualisation tools (eg: `mikenye/tar1090`) or data collectors (eg: `mikenye/adsb-to-influxdb`).

To do this, you can create a second container to act as an MLAT hub.

Here are example service definitions (from a `docker-compose.yml` file) for `readsb`, `mlathub`, `adsb2influxdb` and `tar1090`.

```

In this example:

* `readsb` reads and demodulates the ADSB data from the RTLSDR.
* Other services (such as `adsbx`, `piaware` and `rbfeeder` - not shown) pull ADSB data from `readsb`, perform multilateration, and have their resulting MLAT data published on TCP port `30105`.
* `mlathub` connects to the services providing MLAT results (via `READSB_NET_CONNECTOR`), and combines them into a single feed, available on TCP port `30105` (via `READSB_NET_BEAST_OUTPUT_PORT=30105`).
* `readsb` pulls these MLAT results (via a `READSB_NET_CONNECTOR`) so MLAT results show up in its webapp. It is important to note that MLAT results are NOT fed to feeders, which is the desired approach.
* `adsb2influxdb` pulls these MLAT results (via `MLATHOST`) so MLAT metrics are sent to InfluxDB.
* `tar1090` pulls these MLAT results (via `MLATHOST`) so MLAT positions show up in tar1090's web interface.

**You must make absolutely certain that `READSB_FORWARD_MLAT` is NOT set on your main `readsb` instance!** This is why we perform the MLAT hub functionality in a separate instance of `readsb`. You do not want to cross-contaminate MLAT results between feeders. Doing so will almost certainly result in your MLAT results being rejected, and/or may end up getting you ignored/banned from feeding services.

## Grafana Dashboard

If you're using `INFLUXDBURL` and pushing metrics into InfluxDB, I've put together an example Grafana dashboard, which can be found here:

<https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/13168>

## InfluxDB Schema

If `INFLUXDBURL` is set, an instance of Telegraf will be started within the container, and metrics will be written to the InfluxDB.

The database `readsb` will be created if it does not exist.

Within this database are the following measurements:

| `local_unknown_icao`            | float | Number of Mode S messages which looked like they might be valid but we didn't recognize the ICAO address and it was one of the message types where we can't be sure it's valid in this case. |
| `max_distance_in_metres`        | float | Maximum range in metres |
| `max_distance_in_nautical_miles`| float | Maximum range in nautical miles |
| `messages`                      | float | Total number of messages accepted by readsb from any source |
| `remote_accepted`               | float | Number of valid Mode S messages accepted over the network with N-bit errors corrected. |
| `remote_modeac`                 | float | Number of Mode A / C messages received. |
| `remote_modes`                  | float | Number of Mode S messages received. |
| `tracks_mlat_position`          | float | Tracks consisting of a position derived from MLAT |
| `tracks_new`                    | float | Total tracks (aircrafts) created. Each track represents a unique aircraft and persists for up to 5 minutes. |
| `tracks_single_message`         | float | Tracks consisting of only a single message. These are usually due to message decoding errors that produce a bad aircraft address. |
| `tracks_with_position`          | float | Tracks consisting of a position. |

## Estimating PPM

Every RTL-SDR dongle will have a small frequency error as it is cheaply mass produced and not tested for accuracy.  This frequency error is linear across the spectrum, and can be adjusted in most SDR programs by entering a PPM (parts per million) offset value. This image allows you to adjust the PPM figure using the `READSB_RTLSDR_PPM` environment variable.

To estimate your RTL-SDR's PPM, you can:

* Stop the `readsb` container if it is running (freeing up the RTL-SDR for use)
* Running `docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /scripts/estimate_rtlsdr_ppm.sh --device /dev/bus/usb ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf:latest`. This takes about 30 minutes.
* Updating your `readsb` container with the suggested PPM value

Example output is as follows:

$ docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /scripts/estimate_rtlsdr_ppm.sh --device /dev/bus/usb ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf:latest

```

In this instance, the RTL-SDR has a PPM of 1, so we would set the environment variable `READSB_RTLSDR_PPM=1`.
